## 📚 Topics Covered

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism through character classes and shared behavior.  
- **Class Inheritance Structure:** All heroes inherit from a base `Character` class, promoting clean, DRY code.  
- **Game Logic & State Management:** Turn-based combat system with tracking for health, abilities, and game flow.  
- **Randomization:** Use of Python’s `random` module for attacks, healing, and abilities.  
- **User Interaction:** Console-based input/output for real-time player decisions.  
- **Modular Code Design:** Separation of logic into clearly defined classes and functions for maintainability.
- **AI Utilization:** Integrated AI assistance via ChatGPT/CoPilot to help design, refactor, and document the code effectively.
